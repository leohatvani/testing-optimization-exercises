# Clustering Exercises

We recommend that to create a dataset for clustering, you break down the data from the first exercise into a number of smaller datasets. For each book in the first exercise, break it up into segments no larger than 1000 words with care that the break between segments does not occur in the middle of a sentence. Name these files after the book and the segment number.
