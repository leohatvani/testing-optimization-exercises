# Imbalanced Learning Exercises

The files provided in the first exercise represent imbalanced dataset as there are 5 test cases for the first functional group, 10 for the second, 9 for the third, and 3 for the fourth. These files can be used for imbalanced classification or converted into a graph where nodes represent files belonging to the same functional group.
